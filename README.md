# REST Web Camera server

## Short description

The server operates in the REST architecture mode. The server can accept POST requests and respond with JSON objects. 
The server is designed to collect images from cameras (devices) and forwards messages between devices to control the periphery via an HTTP 2 connection. 
A detailed implementation of an external device based on "ESP32-CAM" is given in the example "webcamdevice".
An example of a desktop application for external device controlling and viewing images is "webcamclientviewer".
